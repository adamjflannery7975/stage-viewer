[C]					[C]                                   				[G]
Someone told me long ago	There's a calm before the storm, I know
                   		[C]
It's been coming for some time
[C]					[C]                          		[G]
When its over, so they say	It'll rain a sunny day, I know
    				[C]
Shining down like water

[C]					[C]                                   			[G]
Yesterday and days before	Sun is cold and rain is hard, I know

Been that way for all my time
[C]					[C]                          		[G]
'Til forever on it goes	Through the circle fast and slow I know
			[C]
It can't stop, I wonder
